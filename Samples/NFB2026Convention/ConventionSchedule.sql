-- ConventionSchedule.sql - the full NFB 2026 convention schedule with
-- each event's location, resolved through the maps table.

-- The maps join pattern: a map row relates two records by (table,
-- unq) pairs. Both tbl columns are filtered explicitly and the join
-- uses '=', so a unq value can never match across the wrong tables.
