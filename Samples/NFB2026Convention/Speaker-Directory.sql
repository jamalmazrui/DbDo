-- Speaker-Directory.sql
-- A directory of everyone presenting at the convention: name, the
-- organization and role they are billed under, how many sessions they
-- appear on, and -- where it could be verified -- a link to their official
-- bio or professional profile. Open NFB2026Convention.db, run this with
-- Invoke Script, then Export the result (Control+Shift+X) if you want to
-- keep a copy as a document or spreadsheet.
--
-- This is the payoff of two things the database keeps separate but joins
-- on demand: the maps table records who presents (kind = 'presents'), and
-- the contacts table carries a 'url' for each person it could be confirmed
-- for. A blank link just means no authoritative page was verified for that
-- person -- the row is still complete and useful.
--
-- The join is c.unq = m.unq1: a person's identity is first|middle|last,
-- which is the value every 'presents' map stores on its contacts side.
-- GROUP BY collapses a person's several sessions into one directory line
-- and COUNT(*) reports how many there are.
