-- SpeakerSessions.sql - every event a given person presents, chairs,
-- or leads, with their stated role for each. Change the last_name

-- This is the canonical "all events related to a contact" query: the
-- IN-subquery through maps keeps the outer SELECT single-table, so
-- the resulting recordset remains editable in DbDo.
